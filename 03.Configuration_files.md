### 3.1 Get the necessary information
You can learn a lot here: https://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/configuration/configuration_files/

In the conf folder, you will create three files: karyotype-colors, links, and data.conf. 

### 3.2 karyotipe.colors.conf 

```
cd bacteria/conf
nano karyotipe.colors.conf
```

In the document add this:

```
<colors>
# Define colors for genomic elements in a bacterial genome
chromosome = blue #Modify color
plasmid    = green #Modify color
gene       = red #Modify color
# Add if necessary other genomic elements and their colors
</colors>
```

The colors in this file and in subsequent files should be defined in your colors.conf file located in the etc folder.

```
cd ../etc
head colors.conf
```
```
#Output:
# RGB color definition. Colors are refered to within configuration files
# by their name. In order to use a color, you must define it here.
#
# Default triplet is rgb
#
# red = 255,0,0
# red = rgb(255,0,0)
#
# You can use LCH and HSV also
#
```

To verify that the color is defined use grep:
```
grep "red" colors.conf
```

```
#Output:
# RGB color definition. Colors are refered to within configuration files
# red = 255,0,0
# red = rgb(255,0,0)
# red = hsv(0,1,1)
# red = lch(54,105,40)
# Common colors (red, green, blue, etc) are already defined in 7
# vvlHUE (very very light HUE, e.g. vvlred)
# vlHUE (very light HUE, e.g. vlred)
# lHUE  (light HUE, e.g. red)
# HUE   (e.g. red)
# dHUE  (dark HUE, e.g. dred)
# vdHUE (very dark HUE, e.g. vdred))
# vvdHUE (very very dark HUE, e.g. vvdred))
# Pure colors are prefixed with "p" (e.g. pred, dpred, vdpred) and
vvlred  = reds-7-seq-1
vlred   = reds-7-seq-2
lred    = reds-7-seq-3
red     = reds-7-seq-4
dred    = reds-7-seq-5
vdred   = reds-7-seq-6
vvdred  = reds-7-seq-7
vvlpred = 255,82,82
vlpred  = 255,63,63
lpred   = 255,41,41
pred    = 255,0,0
dpred   = 237,0,0
vdpred  = 219,0,0
vvdpred = 201,0,0
```

For example, "red" is defined as "reds-7-seq-4", and you can see other shades of red defined by the same palette, as well as other reds by the RGB 
system.

If you want to add other colors that are not already defined in the file, you can do so using the RGB system. For instance, "dpink" is not in your
colors file, so I added it to mine:

```
nano colors.conf
#Add this to the file
dpink = 255,8,74
```

### 3.3 links.conf
Once you added all your desired colors go to conf directory again and create the links file

```
cd ../conf
nano links.conf
```

Inside the document add this:
```
<links>
</links>
```

### 3.4 data.conf
The data.conf file should be structured as follows for the first step to buil the positions of genes.
Modify all the parameters if you want:

```
<plots>

<plot>
    type = connector
    file = /path/to/your/bacteria/data/genes.txt
    r1   = 1.05r
    r0   = 1.00r
    color = red  
    thickness = 3.5p 
    padding = 5p
</plot>


<plot>
    type = text
    file = /path/to/your/bacteria/data/genes.txt
    r1   = 1.10r
    r0   = 1.06r
    label_size = 20p
    label_font = bold
    padding = 5p
    color = bpurple
    show_links = no
    link_thickness = 2p
    link_color = black
</plot>
</plots>
```

Now go to :
