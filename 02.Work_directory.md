### 2.1 Create your work directory
Once you have obtained all the necessary files as described previously, create your own working directory and copy the etc and fonts directories to your work directory

```
mkdir bacteria
cd bacteria
cp -r /Downloads/circos-0.69-9/etc .
cp -r /Downloads/circos-0.69-9/fonts .
ls
```

```
#Output:
etc/
fonts/
```

Create a conf and a data directory (empty so far)
```
mkdir conf
mkdir data
ls
```

```
#Output:
etc/
fonts/
conf/
data/
```

Now yoy have all the necessary directories, and you can build your configuration files as indicated here: https://github.com/LauraCarrillo89/How_to_plot_with_circos_in_your_local_machine/blob/main/03.Configuration_of_colors.md
