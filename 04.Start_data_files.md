### 4.1 Directory of the data files
The data folder is empty as previously described. 

```
cd bacteria/data
ls
```

### 4.2 genes.txt
Create the file genes.txt

```
nano genes.txt
```

Add the information of the genes you placed in the data.conf file described earlier to this folder.

```
contig1	1441315	1442157	folP	color=blue
contig1	1655066	1657192	fusA	color=blue
contig1	1657210	1657515	rpsJ	color=blue
contig1	1663644	1663913	rpsN	color=orange
contig1	1664399	1664950	rplF	color=blue
contig1	1802938	1804896	gyrB	color=blue
```

Here, in the first column, `contig1` is the name of the chromosome. In the second column is the start position of the gene, in the third column is the end position of the gene, in the fourth column 
is the name of the gene, and the fifth column is optional, where you specify the color in which you want that label to appear.
