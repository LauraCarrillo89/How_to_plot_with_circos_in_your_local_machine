### 9.1 Run circos
Now you are able to check the skeleton of the karyotype you built by running Circos as follows:

```
cd bacteria
circos -conf circos.conf
```

It will generate a plot like this:
<img width="468" alt="imagen" src="https://github.com/LauraCarrillo89/How_to_plot_with_circos_in_your_local_machine/assets/105659380/c724b36a-4a32-4c29-824e-2d65f67e9b3a">

If for any reason the genes appear too crowded (for example, they overlap with tick labels as in my case of 1800 kb), or perhaps not all of them are visible because they are too close together and 
only the connector lines are visible without the gene names, we will need to redo some modifications in genes.txt or in data.conf, for example you can do two plot conectors and two plot text 
instead of one and change the radios, etc. You decide!!

Once that the external appearance meets our requirements, we return to the data.conf file and add the information that you desire to plot.
For more information about the data file can be learn here: 

https://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/quick_start/histograms/

So you can modify your currently file like this:

```
cd data/
nano data.conf
```

In the document add the aditional plots:
```
<plots>

<plot>
    type = connector
    file = /path/to/your/bacteria/data/genes.txt
    r1   = 1.05r
    r0   = 1.00r
    color = red
    thickness = 3.5p
    padding = 5p
</plot>


<plot>
    type = text
    file = /path/to/your/bacteria/data/genes.txt
    r1   = 1.10r
    r0   = 1.06r
    label_size = 20p
    label_font = bold
    padding = 5p
    color = bpurple
    show_links = no
    link_thickness = 2p
    link_color = black
</plot>

<plot>
    file        = /path/to/your/bacteria/data/histogram_data.txt # plot inside 1
    r1          = 0.99r # Modify accordly your preferences
    r0          = 0.6r # Modify accordly your preferences
    z           = 0
    orientation = out
    minsize     = 0.0u

    type       = histogram
    extend_bin = no
    fill_color = 255, 0, 0, 1.0 # Modify accordly your preferences

    fill_under = yes
    color      = 0, 0, 0, 1.0

    thickness  = 1

    <rules>
    </rules>

    <axes>
        <axis>
            color     = 255, 0, 0, 1.0 # Modify accordly your preferences

            thickness = 1
            spacing   = 1.0
            y0        = 0 #Modify accordly your data
            y1        = 4 #Modify accordly your data
        </axis>
    </axes>
    <backgrounds>
    </backgrounds>
</plot>
</plot>
```

Run again circos and you can see the complete plot.
Happy plotting!
