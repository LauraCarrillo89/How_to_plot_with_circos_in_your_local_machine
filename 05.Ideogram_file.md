### 5.2 Ideogram structure
Go to your work directory

```
cd bacteria
ls
```

```
Output:
conf/
data/
etc/
fonts/
```

Create the ideogram.conf file
```
nano ideogram.conf
```

Here is an example of the structure from a bacteria:
```
<ideogram>

<spacing>

default = 0u
break   = 0u

</spacing>

# thickness (px) of chromosome ideogram
thickness        = 20p
stroke_thickness = 2
# ideogram border color
stroke_color     = black
fill             = yes
# the default chromosome color is set here and any value
# defined in the karyotype file overrides it
fill_color       = black

# fractional radius position of chromosome ideogram within image
radius         = 0.85r
show_label     = no
label_font     = default
label_radius   = dims(ideogram,radius) + 0.05r
label_size     = 36
label_parallel = yes
label_case     = upper

# cytogenetic bands
band_stroke_thickness = 2

# show_bands determines whether the outline of cytogenetic bands
# will be seen
show_bands            = yes
# in order to fill the bands with the color defined in the karyotype
# file you must set fill_bands
fill_bands            = yes

</ideogram>
```
