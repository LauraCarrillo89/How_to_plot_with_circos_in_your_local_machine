### 1.1 Install perl
All the steps necessary to install Circos can be found at this link:

```
https://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/configuration/unix_vs_windows/
```

However, the most efficient way to avoid installation problems is to have the latest version of Perl.

If you are using macOS or Linux, Perl is already installed as mentioned on the page. You just need to ensure you have the latest version as indicated whit this code:

```
perl -v
```

If you are a Windows user, I highly recommend installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), as it will be the easiest way to install and run Circos.

If you don't have the latest version of Perl, even though the Circos page mentions the minimum version required to run it, it is much easier to simply update your current version than to try to fix 
all the issues that may arise if you don't. 

To get the latest version of Perl, follow the instructions on this page:
```
https://www.cpan.org/src/README.html
```

Once you have the latest version of Perl, simply install the modules required by Circos as detailed on this link:
```
https://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/configuration/installation/
```

To do this, as mentioned on the page, open CPAN and install the modules one by one:
```
cpan
install SVG
install Statistics::Basic
install Text::Format
install Params::Validate
install Font::TTF::Font
install Clone
install Math::Bezier
install Set::IntSpan
install GD::Polyline
install Math::Round
install GD
install Math::VecStat
```

You may encounter issues with some modules as described on the page. If this happens, you can use sudo apt-get on Linux or Homebrew for macOS, as suggested.

For example, to install the GD module:
```
#First, update your system as follows:
sudo apt-get update
#Install the module:
sudo apt-get install libgd-dev libgd3
cpan install GD
```

On macOS, use Homebrew:
```
brew install gd
cpan install GD
```

After installing all the modules (all installations should end with "OK" to confirm they were installed correctly), proceed to install the additional modules required as indicated on the page.

```
Config::General
Font::TTF
GD
List::MoreUtils
Math::Bezier
Math::Round
Math::VecStat
Params::Validate
Readonly
Regexp::Common
Set::IntSpan (v1.16 or later)
Text::Format
```

Once you have downloaded all the modules, proceed to download Circos as indicated on the page:

```
https://circos.ca/software/download/
```

Unzip the program, and you will have a folder with everything you need to run Circos.

```
cd circos-0.69-9/
ls
```

```
